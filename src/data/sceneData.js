    title: 'The Problem',
    content: 'AI image generation excels at creating beautiful single images, but maintaining style consistency across a sequence is remarkably challenging. When you generate multiple frames, each tends to be a "random one-off" rather than feeling like part of the same world.',

    title: 'Dataset Curation',
    content: 'I trained a lightweight, focused model rather than using massive general collection models. Careful curation meant selecting images that shared visual DNA—similar brush techniques, color palettes, and artistic approaches that could inform consistent style generation.',

    title: 'Technical Approach',
    content: 'I experimented with conditioning techniques using masks and depth maps, then trained a niji-6 drawing model specifically for consistency. The goal: lock in brush language, palette, and character identity so each generated frame feels intentionally crafted, not accidental.',

    title: 'The Hard Part',
    content: 'Getting consistency across frames—pose, materials, stroke weight—proved far more challenging than generating a single pretty image. Each frame needs to honor the previous while introducing natural variation. Too much consistency feels robotic; too little breaks the world.',

    title: 'Style-Locking Success',
    content: 'The breakthrough came when the model learned to maintain consistent brush language and palette choices. Suddenly, generated sequences felt cohesive—like pages from the same sketchbook rather than random samples from different artists.',

    title: 'World Building',
    content: 'Character identity and environmental consistency became the foundation for visual storytelling. When AI maintains context across frames, it opens possibilities for coherent world-building—each image contributing to a larger narrative rather than standing alone.',

    title: 'Key Insights',
